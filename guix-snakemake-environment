### Set up a pure environment for snakemake.el commands
###
### If `snakemake-shell-file-name' points to this file,
### `snakemake-term-start' will start a terminal with an environment
### that exposes snakemake and the dependencies defined in "guix.scm",
### a file which should be located in the same directory as the
### current Snakefile.

guix environment --pure -m manifest.scm --ad-hoc snakemake

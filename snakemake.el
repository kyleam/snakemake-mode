;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a popup interface, built on Magit's popup
;; library [1], for calling Snakemake [2].  The main entry point is
;; `snakemake-popup', which you should consider giving a global key
;; binding.
;;
;; The popup currently includes four actions, all which lead to a
;; Snakemake call.  What's different between the actions is how
;; targets are selected.
;;
;; snakemake-build-targets-at-point
;;
;;     This command builds the file name or rule at point if it's a
;;     valid build target.
;;
;;     How the file name targets are retrieved depends on functions in
;;     `snakemake-file-targets-hook'.  The default functions grab file
;;     names from Dired, Org links, and general text under point that
;;     looks like a file name.
;;
;; snakemake-build
;;
;;     This action allows you to edit the command before running it.
;;
;;     It tries to guess what the target name should be, but it
;;     doesn't verify if this target is actually a build target.  This
;;     lax behavior is useful to, for example, pull in an input file
;;     name from Dired and then edit the extension to get the desired
;;     output name.
;;
;; snakemake-build-rule-target
;;
;;     This command prompts with a list of all target rules for the
;;     current Snakefile and builds the selected one.
;;
;; snakemake-build-file-target
;;
;;     Like `snakemake-build-rule-target', but this command prompts
;;     for a file name, using the file name at point, if it's a valid
;;     target, as the default completion.
;;
;;     When `snakemake-file-target-program' is set to a program that
;;     outputs a list of files, the user is prompted with that list
;;     instead.  snakemake.el's source repo contains a script,
;;     "snakemake-file-targets", that can be used for this purpose.
;;     It outputs a list of all concrete output files for the current
;;     Snakefile.
;;
;; All these commands use the Snakefile contained in the
;; `default-directory' of the current buffer.  If
;; `snakemake-root-dir-function' is non-nil, this function should
;; return a secondary directory (e.g., a project repository root) in
;; which to look for a Snakefile if there isn't one in the current
;; directory.
;;
;; By default, commands are executed through `compile'.  However, a
;; terminal can be created with `snakemake-term-start', in which case
;; commands are sent there instead.
;;
;; In addition to the popup commands, there are commands for showing
;; and saving the dependency graph of a target.  The command
;; `snakemake-graph' displays the graph in a buffer.  From this
;; buffer, `snakemake-graph-save' can be called to save the graph to
;; an output file.
